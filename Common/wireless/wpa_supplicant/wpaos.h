 * function name. This can be done on function-by-function basis since the
 * defines here are only used if build_config.h does not define the os_* name.
 * If needed, os_*.c file can be used to implement the functions that are not
 * included in the C library on the target system. Alternatively,
 * OS_NO_C_LIB_DEFINES can be defined to skip all defines here in which case
 * these functions need to be implemented in os_*.c file for the target system.
